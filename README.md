# Guide for Data Science Projects in 2023
This repository explains on defining a problem statement and performing necessary tasks to provide meaningful results.
A walkthrough on a structured approach to ensure a successful completion of a data science project.

# How to start?

**Find/Define a problem statement**:
The problem statement is a critical first step in any data science project, providing a clear definition of the problem to be solved and guiding the development of research questions and hypotheses to reach a well-defined solution.

**How to find the scope of the problem, and where to begin?**
One approach I personally use to start and solve any case scenario is to use the below method and structure a solution accordingly.

- [x] **Clarify**:
- Define the scope of the problem
- [x] **Constrain**:
-  Refine the problem by setting boundaries and parameters
- [x]**Plan**:
-  Frame your response
-  Data Gathering solutions
-  Collaboration solutions if needed
-  Find the various Statistical analysis that would be implemented
- [x] **Method**:
-  Data Quality Inspection and EDA
-  Data Pre-processing and Feature Engineering (**_Data Cleaning, Data Integration, Data Reduction, Data Transformation & Data Reduction_**)
-  Feature Selection Methodologies 
-  Model Selection & Creation
-  Model Evaluation and Hyper Parameter Tuning
-  Result Visualization
-  Model Deployment
- [x] **Conclude**:
-  Provide a conclusion by explaining the problem statementâ€™s significance and decisions to be taken based on the results

-   #    Feature Engineering:
    -   Perform appropriate data Analysis as mentioned above to get a meaningful set of attributes

-   #    Feature Selection:

-   #    Model Creation and Evaluation:   


-   #    **Model Deployment**:






# Prerequisite needed to solve problems:
Below are few prerequisites that I personally consider to be very useful to solve a use case scenario.

## 1. Python Programming Language
